# Hey there! I'm fbratten ðŸš€

I'm an AI tinkerer with a passion for automating everything that can be automated. As a multi-OS user, I'm comfortable in Windows, Linux, and macOS, and I believe in using the best tools for the job. I'm also a huge advocate for open source and love collaborating with the community to build amazing things.

- ðŸŽ¯ **Specialties:** Automation & DevOps, Open Source, Full-Stack Development, and AI/ML Engineering.
- âš¡ **Tech Stack:** Python, Bash, PowerShell, React, Node.js, Azure, Docker, and Kubernetes.
- ðŸ”§ **Approach:** I focus on creating robust, self-healing systems and elegant, efficient code.

## What Iâ€™m Building

I'm currently focused on building an adaptive creation engineâ€”an agent framework where the AI learns continuously. This project also involves developing an AI interaction and workflow SaaS, a playground for self-healing systems, and an agent platform that uses federated learning for information retrieval.
